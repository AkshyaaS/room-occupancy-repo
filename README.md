# MLProject - Room Occupancy detection

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This project focuses on developing a Room Occupancy Detector using Machine Learning. The system learns from historical data, builds prediction models, and accurately identifies the presence of individuals in a given room.<br>

<h2>Market Insights</h2>
The People Counting Systems market is expected to grow from USD $818 million in 2020 to USD $1.3 billion by 2025. Our project addresses key needs post-COVID, such as social distancing, efficient energy management, and continuous room monitoring for enhanced security.<br>

<h2>Sensor Technologies</h2>
We explore various sensor types, including PIR, microwave Infrared, Ultrasonic, and Radar-based sensors, to optimize accuracy in occupancy predictions.<br>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
Utilizing a dataset from the UCI Learning Repository, we tackle the time series and multivariate classification challenge of room occupancy.<br>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
Develop an efficient Room Occupancy Detector.<br>
Optimize social distancing and energy management.<br>
Ensure continuous room monitoring for enhanced security.<br>
Join us in redefining intelligent space utilization with our Room Occupancy Detector project.<br>
